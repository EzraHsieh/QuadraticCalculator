# Quadratic Formula Calculator

This is a simple Python program that solves quadratic equations using the quadratic formula. It is based on the lectures by Dr. Joseph Cutrone at Johns Hopkins University.

Given the coefficients of a quadratic equation in the form of `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`, the program calculates and displays the solutions.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `Quadtratic_Calculator.py` file.

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `Quadtratic_Calculator.py` file is located.

4. Run the program by executing the following command:

   ```shell
   python Quadtratic_Calculator.py
   ```

5. Enter the values for coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` as prompted by the program.

6. The program will calculate the solutions and display them on the console.

## Example

Here's an example of how the program can be used:

```shell
$ python quadratic_formula_solver.py

Welcome to the Quadratic Calculator!
----------------------------
Enter a: 1
Enter b: -3
Enter c: 2

The first root is 2.0
The second root is 1.0
```
A graph of the quadratic function is also produced. 
In this example, the quadratic equation `x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0` is solved, and the program displays the solutions `x1 = 2.0` and `x2 = 1.0`.
